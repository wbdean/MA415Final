# MA415Final

## Description

For this project, I explored OSHO fire data across the United States. I was specifically interested in two things: dispatch times for fires and fires where there was a death.

Explore my interactive web-app [here](https://wdean.shinyapps.io/final/) or my final write-up for the project in my repo.

This is my final project for MA 415/615 at Boston University taken in Spring 2016.
